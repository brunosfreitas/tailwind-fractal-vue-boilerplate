### Atomic Design - folder organization

After installing fractal, we added a few folders inside components folder. Each one of those represents a level in the [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) pattern.

### Gulp tasks

We also need a watcher for JS and CSS file changes, we followed the same approach as in this [repo joao-olivio/fractal-css](https://github.com/joao-olivio/fractal-css)


### Vue

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html) Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. 

> npm install vue
