## Step by step - How to make your own

### Git and Node

First of all you need git and node to start anything. Follow their installation instructions here: 

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


### Vue-cli

> npm install -g @vue/cli

After that, create a new vue project with the default options (babel/eslint). In our case we created it in the new folder itself.

> vue create .

The installation should take some minutes, grab a cup of coffee and return to the job! After it's done, your folder should look shomething like this.

In a terminal, run:

> npm run serve

Open the url [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) or the one pointed at the terminal, if everything is right, the vue demo it's running!
